Title "The ring_nf tactic"

Introduction "
# Algebraic manipulations

Now let's learn about algebraic simplification. Suppose you need to prove that $(x + y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3$.

This is true by the basic laws of algebra - expanding the left side using the distributive law, commutativity, associativity, etc. But doing this by hand would be extremely tedious.

Fortunately, Lean has a powerful tactic called `ring_nf` (\"ring normal form\") that can automatically perform algebraic manipulations like:
- Expanding products
- Collecting like terms
- Rearranging using commutativity and associativity
- Applying the distributive law

When you have an algebraic identity involving addition, subtraction, and multiplication, `ring_nf` can often prove it automatically.

Try it out on this classic binomial expansion!

Conclusion "
Excellent! You've learned the `ring_nf` tactic.

This tactic is incredibly powerful for algebraic manipulations. It automatically handles all the tedious algebra that would take many steps to do by hand.

Your toolkit now includes:
- `exact hypothesis_name` for when a hypothesis exactly matches your goal
- `rfl` for proving something equals itself
- `rewrite [hypothesis_name]` for rewriting using equalities
- `ring_nf` for algebraic simplifications and expansions

As we move into real analysis proper, you'll find that `ring_nf` is invaluable for dealing with polynomial expressions, which appear everywhere in calculus!
